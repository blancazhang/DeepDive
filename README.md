# DeepDive
Deep Dive was born at TechTogether Boston and is a social media background check for HR recruiters that uses natural language processing to identify hate speech and offensive language in a potential applicant's twitter.

Model implementation was inspired by Yoon Kim's paper: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1181) and the GloVe pretrained Twitter word embeddings were used
